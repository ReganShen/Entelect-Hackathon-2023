## The Proposal

### Balancing Energy Supply
Our solution proposes a strategic balance between renewable energy supply and traditional energy methods.

**Aim:** To supplement the energy grid with renewable sources, particularly during periods of maintenance for traditional energy facilities.

**Key Idea:** Schedule maintenance activities for coal-powered plants during periods of high renewable energy production. This approach ensures that when traditional energy output is reduced for maintenance, the deficit is compensated by renewable sources.

## Challenge
**How to anticipate periods of high renewable energy availability?**

### Solution
Utilize predictive analytics to forecast renewable energy production based on weather data.

### Expected Outcome
By aligning maintenance schedules with renewable energy peaks, we aim to maintain consistent energy supply and reduce instances of load shedding.

### Benefit
This strategy leads to more efficient grid management and optimized use of renewable energy sources.
